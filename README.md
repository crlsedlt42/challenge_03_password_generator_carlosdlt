# <Challenge03-Password-Generator-CarlosDLT>

On this challenge I was tasked to create a password generator.
My goal was to use JavaScript to create a random password for the user to use as needed. 
The password generator helps the user create a strong password that provides greater security. 
The assignment taught me how to use ALERTS, PROMPTS, CONFIRM, how to use CONCAT to combine arrays that are in variable or in functions, and a deeper understanding of FOR LOOPS.

## HOW TO USE PASSWORD GENERATOR

In order for the password generator to work correctly a certain criteria needs to be met to create a new password.

# CRITERIA

* First, a number from 8 to 128 needs to be inputted into the 'PROMPT' pop-up.
-- If nothing was type or a character that isn't a number between 8 and 128, the user will see a message to restart and input a number to be able to generate a new password. --

* Second, a series of CONFIRM pop-ups will ask if the new password the user wants to create contain specific characters that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters.
-- If all criteria is denied, the user will see a message to select at least one specific character trait. --

* Third, once the user selects which criteria they want to include in their new password, the webpage will display a randomized password.
